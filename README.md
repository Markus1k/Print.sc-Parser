# Print.sc-Parser
Very old project from ~2015. Code was very junky so i rewrote half. The idea is simple - Goes on prnt.sc/######. # - random char or number. And makes screenshot of it. Created for fun.
If you want just use program:
1.Go to Print.sc-Parser/prntscparser/prntscparser/bin
and download Debug folder.
2.Run prntscparser.exe.
